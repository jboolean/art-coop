**No one knows what arts and culture will look like after the pandemic.**

Sixty-three percent of creatives have become fully unemployed.

A third of museums say they are likely to close forever.

Black and Indigenous people have a COVID-19 death rate of double or more than the death rate of White people in the US.

And yet, foundation giving in 2020 documented that only 5 percent of
pandemic-response dollars were intended for communities of color.

Around half of 1 percent of annual foundation giving directly supports women and
girls of color.

And less than half of 1 percent goes to Native Americans.

What would the cultural economy be like if it loved Black and Indigenous
people?

**All around the country, the people who have been most harmed by our current systems are practicing self-determination and community wealth.**

The movement for *permanently affordable space* in Oakland, places culture at the center of the work.

The first *democratically managed investment fund in the country* -- making non-extractive loans to community members -- says: “cultural workers are economy builders.”

Culture bearers lead the oldest native co-op in the country.

Artists started the oldest non-extractive Venture Capital firm in the US.

A co-op giving 35,000 freelancers the benefit of full-time employment was founded by artists. It includes employment insurance and pension.

The nationally recognized legal organization that supports Solidarity Economy groups was co-founded by a cartoonist.

Black Lives Matter was co-founded by an artist.

This work is not new. Creatives are “going back to the future,” to practices of shared livelihoods rooted in cultural traditions.

**Why should culture and economic innovation go together?**

Because…

Right now, we have a superstar system where the winners take all and the rest are left with crumbs.

Just like art, housing and dignified work are human rights.

Artists are the original gig workers.

Culture-making and political organizing go hand-in-hand.

We want a world where *everyone’s needs are met so everyone can participate in the remaking of culture* and society.

An artist living in a community land trust in New York City will have *27 hours a week to make art*, compared to an artist in market-priced housing who will have 4 hours a week for artmaking.

We must repair centuries of injustice.

What do a *mutual aid networks*,
*worker co-ops*,
*community land trusts*,
*participatory budgeting*,
*and time banks*
have in common?

**Community ownership and democratic governance that builds political, cultural, and economic power.**

When these hyper-local initiatives get together, they have enormous power.

This emergent movement goes by many names -- <small>economic democracy, new economy, regenerative economics, degrowth, the commons, local community economic development, democratic socialism, just transition, dual power, liberation economy</small> -- but internationally, it is known as the Social and Solidarity Economy, or Solidarity Economy for short. It provides resilience against crisis and has lasting impact when supported as a holistic system.

**The people who have been most harmed are creating community-controlled, hyper-local economies that are resilient amidst crisis.**

**The systems that artists want are not only possible—they already exist**, and can be strengthened and cultivated with intention.
