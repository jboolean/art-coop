    This report, commissioned by Grantmakers in the Arts, is about the ways that
    arts and culture grantmakers can engage in systems-change work. The cultural
    sector is actively seeking alternatives to business-as-usual to create
    economic and racial justice in the sector and beyond. Grantmakers can play a
    role in the transformation of the sector by following the lead of Black,
    Indigenous, People of Color, disabled, queer, trans, and working class
    creatives who are innovating models for self-determination and community
    wealth. For specific suggestions, see the full report.
