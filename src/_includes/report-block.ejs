    This report is about the ways that
    <strong
      >arts and culture grantmakers can engage in systems-change work</strong
    >. The cultural sector is actively seeking alternatives to business-as-usual
    to create economic and racial justice in the sector and beyond. Grantmakers
    can play a role in the transformation of the sector by following the lead of
    Black, Indigenous, People of Color, disabled, queer, trans, and working
    class creatives who are innovating models for self-determination and
    community wealth. For specific suggestions, see the full report and the
    Action Checklist.
