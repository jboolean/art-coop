  <p>
    We are incubating a cooperative model of study. We aim to become
    <strong>socially and financially self-determined</strong> and invite you to
    support us in this effort with gifts of time, money, art, and open-source
    code. Any surplus from Phase 1 will support Phase 2 and 3 of our work.
