        Black and Indigenous people have a

        And yet, foundation giving in 2020 documented that only 5 percent of
        pandemic-response dollars were intended for communities of color.

      <p>
        Around <strong>half of 1 percent</strong> of annual foundation giving
        directly supports women and girls of color.

      <p>And less than half of 1 percent goes to Native Americans.</p>
