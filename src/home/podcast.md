Art.coop is excited to share that, in partnership with [Yerba Buena Center for the Arts](https://ybca.org/), we have produced a a pilot season podcast on the Solidarity Economy and the artists and culture workers who are building it in their communities. 

With the support of Meerkat Media Cooperative, Daniel Park (Obvious Agency, Guilded, USFWC), Maddy Clifford aka MADlines, Carlos Uriona (Double Edge Theatre) and Rhonda Anderson (Ohketeau Cultural Center), Clara Takarabe, Cierra Peters and Nia Evans (Boston Ujima Project), and our Co-Organizers Caroline, Marina, and Nati, Art.coop invite listeners to **Remember the Future** togetherby listening to the stories of artists and culture bearers who know that the practices of the Solidarity Economy are not some new technology, but actually are ways of being in relationship with people and planet that are as old as time. They are our ancestral practices. 

In this 7 episode narrative pilot, listeners learn: You don’t have to be a starving artist or a sell out. You can find work where you joyfully live your values and pay the bills. We meet QTBIPOC creatives who are firing their bosses, freeing the land, electing themselves, and building livelihoods based on care, cooperation, mutual aid, and solidarity. Every other episode grounds listeners in a practice-based offering to activate the solidarity economy in their body, in their community, and in their context today.
