### Creative Co-ops, Cultural Work in the Solidarity Economy, and the Potential for Artistic Liberation

In the coming days, months, and years, our world will critically reflect not on the havoc this period of compounding chaos and crisis wreaked, but rather on the changes we made in response. At a time of such variant institutional and interpersonal violence, how did we, as ancestors, seed sustainable kindness for those who would come after us?

The crises themselves are clear: the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has left our (im)migrant, displaced, working poor, rural, disabled, elderly, trans, queer, and BIPOC communities financially, physically, socially, and culturally devastated. Multiple debt buckets are overflowing and flooding the lives of many, including young graduates---mostly those of color. The world, quite literally, is burning away due to unmitigated climate catastrophes.

Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) most harmed by our extractive economic system have continued the courageous work of studying together to heal, imagine, and enact creative futures of shared power and shared wealth. From guru-shishya paramparas in South Asia to Valor y Cambio in Puerto Rico to the Young Lords in Harlem, collectively BIPOC-led cultural learning spaces are keystones of resistance and innovation in the arts.

This work has roots in the Black liberation movement in the United States and has been developed by cooperatives in an internationally recognized set of principles.

### The Solidarity Economy Ecosystem in the U.S.

A number of organizations that support the Solidarity Economy in the United States have emerged in the past decade, and in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number and diversity of entities providing support to Solidarity Economy organizations. However, although artists and culture-bearers participate in many of these as workers and beneficiaries, few of these entities place an emphasis on art and culture.

Here are a few examples of arts and culture groups and initiatives in the Solidarity Economy. As shown throughout the [report](http://art.coop/#resources), all networks and infrastructure in the Solidarity Economy---regardless of their emphasis on arts and culture---will support artists and culture-bearers.
