        Around <strong>½ of 1 percent</strong> of annual foundation giving

        Right now, we have a superstar system where the

      </p>
      <p>Just like art, housing and dignified work are human rights.</p>
      <p>Artists are the original gig workers.</p>
      <p>Culture-making and political organizing go hand-in-hand.</p>

        This emergent movement goes by many names &mdash; economic democracy,
        new economy, regenerative economics, degrowth, the commons, local
        community economic development, democratic socialism, just transition,
        dual power, liberation economy &mdash; but internationally, it is known
        as the Social and Solidarity Economy, or Solidarity Economy for short.
        It provides resilience against crisis and has lasting impact when
