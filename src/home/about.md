### Our Vision

Artists who are fed up with the current system are connected and know their power. There is a hub where artists get money, ideas, and tools to strengthen their communities. Art.coop is part of the movement to remember future Art Worlds with community-control\* at the core.

### Our Mission

We are working for a future in which artists closest to the pain of an extractive economy know their power and use it to dismantle the current system.
We resource a community of artists committed to building the art worlds we deserve.
Art.coop is located in the U.S. but is rooted in the international Solidarity Economy movement.
