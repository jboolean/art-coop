There is an alternative to exploitation, isolation, and fear. \
\
Let's build cooperative, connected, and care-based futures. 

In March 2021, Art.coop launched with a [REPORT](http://art.coop/#report). In September and October of 2021, we held [Study-into-Action](http://art.coop/#study) with 105 cultural innovators. Listen to our [PODCAST](https://art.coop/#podcast) and take a free online [COURSE](https://art.coop/#courses). Attend our [Move the Money series](https://www.giarts.org/move-money-grantmakers-arts-artcoop-solidarity-economy-discussion-series). Find us on [IG](https://www.instagram.com/_artcoop/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_artcoop). We exist to support creatives in the [Solidarity Economy movement](https://art.coop/#examples) and to usher in the [transformation](https://art.coop/#transform).

Yes, artists are workers.

We work together to resist exploitation and create jobs, housing, and resource exchanges that value artists as whole people.¬†

We join the Solidarity Economy movement as we fire our bosses, free the land, and elect ourselves.

We are empowered change-makers who actively choose the lives we want to lead.¬†

We can live our values and do joyful work that pays the bills.
