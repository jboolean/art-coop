As the cultural sector actively seeks alternatives to business-as-usual to create economic and racial justice in the sector and beyond, the main barriers for many Solidarity Economy cultural entities include

1. a lack of understanding by grantmakers of systems-change and existing power imbalances
2. ways to support cooperative governance in the sector
3. the best tools of support for Solidarity Economy business structures, deliberate incubation, and start-up capital, and
4. ways to change whole systems by transforming investments and endowments and advocating for systems-change policies to create a fiscal and legal enabling environment for Solidarity Economy cultures to thrive.
